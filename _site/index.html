	<h1>Rajeshwari Majumdar</h1>
	<p> Welcome! I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale University (Identity & Conflict Lab, The MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies). I received my Ph.D. in Politics from New York University in 2024. </a></p>
	<p> My research interests lie in political behavior, experimental methods, and Indian politics. Broadly, I examine how group identities shape individualsâ€™ reactions to information about contentious political issues. In particular, I study ethnic identity (focusing on interethnic relations and ethnic nationalism) and partisan identity (focusing on ideological and partisan motivations in countries with traditionally weak party ties). I also have an active research agenda geared towards understanding the role of WhatsApp in the politics of developing countries. My work is forthcoming in <i>Political Behavior</i> and has received accolades from multiple APSA sections and MPSA. </p>
