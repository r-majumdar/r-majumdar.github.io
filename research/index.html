	 	<h3>Partisan Identity, Counter-Attitudinal Information, and Selective Criticism in India</h3>
  	    <p style="font-size: 16px"><b>Abstract.</b> How do people react to information that challenges their party’s policies? While most of the existing literature focuses on possible changes in issue opinions, we know less about other implicit and explicit ways in which people may contend with counter-attitudinal information. In an online experiment in India, I present participants with potentially incongruent information about a controversial economic policy and ask them to evaluate the quality of this information. Strong party supporters (nonsupporters) feel that an article that criticizes (praises) the policy is of very poor quality. Further, people are much more likely to ignore the biased nature of an article if it reinforces their priors – but complain if it does not. Yet, although I observe strong affective reactions against information that is counter-attitudinal, there is no evidence of opinion backlash; instead, there is (weak) evidence of participants updating in the direction of the counter-attitudinal information. These findings reinforce the importance of studying reactions to counter-attitudinal information above and beyond issue-specific opinions.</a></p>

  	<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">Reducing Prejudice Through Conversation</h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; margin : 0; padding-top:0">(with Richard Bonneau, Jonathan Nagler, and Joshua A. Tucker)</p>
  	    <p style="font-size: 16px"><b>Abstract.</b> In places with considerable ethnic conflict, can a series of conversations with an outgroup member affect majority group members’ attitudes about the outgroup and about intergroup relations more broadly? We design an experiment in which we bring together Hindus and Muslims in India for five days of guided conversations on WhatsApp, the most popular messaging platform in India. We investigate the extent to which (a) chatting with an outgroup member and (b) the topics discussed affect perceptions of the outgroup and opinions about related social and political issues. We find that intergroup conversation greatly reduces Hindu prejudice against Muslims, especially when the conversation features non-political issues, and that effects persist for at least two weeks post-treatment. We further observe that intergroup conversation about non-political issues leads to considerably reduced support among Hindus for violence against minorities up to three weeks later, while conversation about political issues significantly decreases approval of the idea that India is a Hindu nation in the short term.</a></p>
