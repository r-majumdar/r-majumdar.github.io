	 	<h3>Partisan Identity, Counter-Attitudinal Information, and Selective Criticism in India</h3>
  	    <p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px"><b>Abstract.</b> How do people react to information that challenges their party’s policies? While most of the existing literature focuses on possible changes in issue opinions, we know less about other implicit and explicit ways in which people may contend with counter-attitudinal information. In an online experiment in India, I present participants with potentially incongruent information about a controversial economic policy and ask them to evaluate the quality of this information. Strong party supporters (non-supporters) feel that an article that criticizes (praises) the policy is of very poor quality. Further, people are much more likely to ignore the biased nature of an article if it reinforces their priors – but complain if it does not. Yet, although I observe strong affective reactions against information that is counter-attitudinal, there is no evidence of opinion backlash;  instead, there is (weak) evidence of people updating in the direction of incongruent information. These findings reinforce the importance of studying reactions to counter-attitudinal information above and beyond issue-specific opinions.</a></p>

  	<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">Reducing Prejudice and Support for Religious Nationalism Through Conversations on WhatsApp</h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; margin : 0; padding-top:0">(with Richard Bonneau, Jonathan Nagler, and Joshua A. Tucker)</p>
  	    <p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px"><b>Abstract.</b> In places with considerable ethnic conflict, can a series of conversations with an outgroup member affect majority group members’ attitudes about the outgroup and about intergroup relations more broadly? We design an experiment in which we bring together Hindus and Muslims in India for five days of conversations on WhatsApp, the most popular messaging platform globally. We investigate the extent to which (a) chatting with an outgroup member and (b) the topics discussed affect perceptions of the outgroup and support for religious nationalism. We find that intergroup conversation greatly reduces Hindu prejudice against Muslims and support for religious nationalist sentiments at least two to three weeks post-conversation. Intergroup conversations about non-political issues are especially effective at reducing prejudice and support for violence, while conversations about political issues substantially decrease approval for hijab bans and the idea that India is a Hindu nation. We examine a series of mechanisms related to knowledge, empathy, and anxiety to provide additional insights on how intergroup conversation mitigates negative attitudes.</a></p>

  	<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">The Effects of WhatsApp on Misinformation Beliefs and Polarization: Evidence from Brazil</h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; margin : 0; padding-top:0">(with Tiago Ventura, Jonathan Nagler, and Joshua A. Tucker)</p>
  	    <p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px"><b>Abstract.</b> 
  	    For years WhatsApp has been the primary social media application in many countries of the Global South. Numerous journalistic and scholarly accounts suggest that the platform has become a fertile ground for the spread of polarizing content and political misinformation, with some going so far as to assert that WhatsApp could have serious impacts on electoral outcomes, episodes of violence, and vaccine hesitancy around the world. However, no studies so far have been able to show causal links between WhatsApp usage and these alleged changes in citizens' attitudes and behaviors. To fill this gap, we conducted a field experiment that reduced users' WhatsApp activity during the Presidential election in Brazil. Our field experiment randomly assigns users to a multi-media deactivation, in which we incentivized them not to access any media, image, or video received on WhatsApp during the weeks leading up to the election on October 2, 2022.   We find that the deactivation significantly reduced subjects’ exposure to false rumors that circulated widely during the weeks before the election. However, beyond a reduction in exposure, we recover null effects for changes in belief accuracy, political polarization, and subjective-well being. Our study expands the growing literature on the causal effects of reducing social media usage on political attitudes by focusing on the role of WhatsApp in misinformation spread and beliefs in the Global South.</a></p>

  	<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">Characterizing Ideology in India</h3> <p style="font-size: 16px; margin : 0; padding-top:0">(with Nicholas Haas)</p>
  	    <p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px"><b>Abstract.</b> 
  	    Do ideology and partisanship matter in developing countries, or is extant scholarship correct to largely dismiss these factors in favor of an understanding of politics as fundamentally clientelist? We study ideology in an online sample (N=2,393) of citizens from across 10 states in India, the world's largest democracy. Applying ideal point estimation techniques commonly used in research on Western populations, we find firstly that Indian respondents can be placed along a single ideological dimension according to their views on  Hindu nationalism, state intervention, and minority rights. In contrast, issues frequently used to capture ideological divides in Western countries perform poorly in the Indian context. Second, we observe that individuals' ideological placements correlate with their partisan affiliations and reported political behaviors. Third, we find in both correlational analyses and an embedded endorsement experiment evidence consistent with a one-party dominant system, wherein feelings toward the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party carry particular import. Our findings indicate that ideology is consequential for Indian politics and may differ in important ways from the West, and call for greater attention to the ideologies of those residing in developing country contexts.</a></p>
