	<h1>Rajeshwari Majumdar</h1>
	<p>Welcome! I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at The George Washington University. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale University, affiliated with the Identity & Conflict Lab in The MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies. I received my Ph.D. in political science from New York University in 2024.</p>
	<p>My research interests lie in political communication, intergroup relations, ethnic nationalism, experimental methods, and Indian politics. Broadly, I investigate how individuals react to information about controversial political and social issues, with a focus on the case of political rhetoric and discourse around religious nationalist policies in India. I also conduct research on the role of WhatsApp in the politics of developing countries.</p>
	<p>My work has been published in <i>Political Behavior</i> and <i>The Journal of Politics</i>. My research has also appeared in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Hindustan Times, and VoxDev. I have received multiple awards for my research, including the Aaron Wildavsky Best Dissertation Award from the APSA Religion and Politics section (2025), the Paul Lazarsfeld Best Paper Award from the APSA Political Communication section (2024), the Best Paper Award from the APSA Information Technology & Politics section (2024), the Distinguished Junior Scholar Award from the APSA Political Psychology section (2024), the MPSA Best Conference Paper Award (2024), and the Best Paper Award from the APSA Experimental Research section (2023).</p>
