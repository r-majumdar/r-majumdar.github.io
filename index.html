	<h1>Rajeshwari Majumdar</h1>
	<p> Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://as.nyu.edu/politics.html">Department of Politics</a> at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>.</p>
	<p> My research interests lie in political behavior, experimental methods, and Indian politics. In my dissertation, I examine how group identity affects reactions to information about contentious political issues, and develop ways to reduce intergroup prejudice and support for religious nationalism. </p>
	<p> You can reach me via <a href="mailto:majumdar@nyu.edu">email</a>.</p>
