	<p> ¡Hola! I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the <a href="http://as.nyu.edu/politics.html">Department of Politics</a> at <a href="nyu.edu">New York University</a>.</p>
	<p> My research explores the political consequences of government behavior that is perceived as unjust with a regional focus in Mexico and Latin America.</p>
	<p> I hold a B.A. in Political Science and a B.A. in International Relations from ITAM (2015). Before coming to NYU, I was the Director of Data Analysis in <a href="https://datacivica.org/">Data Cívica</a>.</p>
	<p> If you want to read me rant about Mexican politics and occasionally movies, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/caro_whitetower">follow me on Twitter</a>. I am also working on an ever-expanding compilation of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Al9JKnrYCCIZKlYyR70ku?si=63d507000c5846ce">the best cover songs</a> you can check out.</p>
