	<h1>Rajeshwari Majumdar</h1>
	<p> Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in the <a style="color:blue;" href="http://as.nyu.edu/politics.html">Department of Politics</a> at New York University. During the 2023-2024 academic year, I am a Graduate School of Arts and Science Dean’s Dissertation Writing Fellow, affiliated with the <a style="color:blue;" href="https://csmapnyu.org/">Center for Social Media and Politics</a> and the <a style="color:blue;" href="https://www.identities-ideologies.org/">Identities & Ideologies Project</a>, and on the academic job market. </a></p>
	<p> My research interests lie in political behavior, experimental methods, and Indian politics. In my dissertation and beyond, I examine how group identities shape individuals’ reactions to information about contentious political issues. In particular, I study ethnic identity (focusing on interethnic relations and ethnic nationalism) and partisan identity (focusing on ideological and partisan motivations in countries with traditionally weak party ties). I also have an active research agenda geared towards understanding the role of WhatsApp in the politics of developing countries. My work is forthcoming in <i>Political Behavior</i>. </p>
