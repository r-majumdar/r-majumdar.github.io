	<h1>Rajeshwari Majumdar</h1>
	<p> Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in the <a style="color:blue;" href="http://as.nyu.edu/politics.html">Department of Politics</a> at New York University. In Fall 2024, I will join Yale University as a postdoctoral researcher at the Identity & Conflict Lab in The MacMillan Center for international and Area Studies.</a></p>
	<p> My research interests lie in political behavior, experimental methods, and Indian politics. In my dissertation and beyond, I examine how group identities shape individualsâ€™ reactions to information about contentious political issues. In particular, I study ethnic identity (focusing on interethnic relations and ethnic nationalism) and partisan identity (focusing on ideological and partisan motivations in countries with traditionally weak party ties). I also have an active research agenda geared towards understanding the role of WhatsApp in the politics of developing countries. My work is forthcoming in <i>Political Behavior</i> and has received accolades from multiple APSA sections and MPSA. </p>
